Hello everybody, in this project i created a shoertner for Long URL, with use of mant technologies and functionallity.
this website sit in Heroku servers, use JSONBINS as Databse and use Nodejs As runtime environment.

before reading try my website : [EGShortURL](https://egshorturl.herokuapp.com/)

## What can Customer Do In EG-Short-URL

- Pick old URL and short it to New URL
- Pick new URL name as Customer wants
- Get Stats about new URL.
- Get Readirect if type non exicting URL
- Get info About Developer

## What Special About my site

- Custome Design with animation to catch Customer eye and keep him in the site, he will come back again.
- Custom 404 Page for bad request in URLs.
- Custome Page for mobile Users to get them best time in site, not just media query.
- Server and Front Checks on URLs To detect User Faults on front to not overload Server and Checks on Server to "Bad" Users.
- Simple Error "alerts" To The User.
- Simple code, Made Sure is fine to read and not divided to many places, tried to keep code short as possible.
- Use JSONBINS as DataBase.
- Use Heroku(env) to keep my Keys Secret.
- Use of SVG as Images on site, give me flexabillty to play with animations and color and sizes easily.
- Didn't Use DB-Class.
- Didn't Use Webpack.

## Why I Didn't Use Webpack

First Read [Why-Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/concepts/why-webpack/).
Webpack main purpose is connect diffrent JS Files. this project has one Not Big js file who dont need to divide because it not long code
and more understandable on his own. so in my opinion Bundle This files in project will only Damage the Readabillty.

## Why i Didn't Use DB Class

class is not something who bring new functionallty, its bring only more convenient way to write code.
in this DB Class, the class do create new Instance of new things, only function. and behave more like Modules.
so in last, i didnt use class who give me something new and i can do better without.
