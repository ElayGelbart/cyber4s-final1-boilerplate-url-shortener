          A URL shortener, also known as a link shortener, seems
          like a simple tool, but it
          is a
          service that can have a dramatic impact on your marketing efforts.
          Link shorteners work by transforming any long URL into a shorter, more readable link. When a user clicks the
          shortened version, they’re automatically forwarded to the destination URL.
          Think of a short URL as a more descriptive and memorable nickname for your long webpage address. You can, for
          example, use a short URL like bit.ly/CelebrateBitly so people will have a good idea about where your link will
          lead before they click it.
          If you’re contributing content to the online world, you need a URL shortener.
          Make your URLs stand out with our easy to use free link shortener above.

          <span class="infoHeadline">Why use URL Shortner</span>
          How many people can even remember a long web address, especially if it has tons of characters and symbols? A
          short URL can make your link more memorable. Not only does it allow people to easily recall and share your
          link
          with others, it can also dramatically improve traffic to your content.
          On a more practical side, a short URL is also easier to incorporate into your collateral – whether you’re
          looking to engage with your customers offline or online.
          Bitly is the best URL shortener for everyone, from influencers to small brands to large enterprises, who are
          looking for a simple way to create, track and manage their links.
